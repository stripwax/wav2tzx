                  ----------------------------------------

  First of all you will probably need some knowledge on how the data is stored
on the tapes (or in the .VOC files) since without it you would not understand
how the switches work...
  Basically the data on the tape is stored as pulses of different frequencies.
The spectrum rom save routine stores two pulses of 855 Z80 Clock Cycles for the
bit 0 and two pulses of 1710 Z80 Clock Cycles. Which means that bit 0 takes
exactly half the time to load in as bit 1 does.
  But for Spectrum to be able to read that data it has to know when to start
reading it. Therefore there is a Pilot signal preceeding the data which has
some 8000 pulses of somewhat smaller frequency infront of the data. After
the pilot signal there are two SYNC pulses, which are considerably smaller
(or with higher frequency) so the spectrum knows that now it has to start
loading the data.
  Basically it all looks like this (when you look at the .VOC file) :

_____-----_____-----_____-----_-____----__--__--____----____----...

______________ ______________| |________________ _______________...
              V               V                 V
         PILOT pulse       SYNC1,2        DATA (10011...)

  So one Pilot pulse is _____ (or -----) , SYNC pulses are _ and - , Bit 0 of
Data is __-- and Bit 1 of Data is ____---- . There might ofcourse be some
minor differences (which is the reason for the switches ;)) .
  The actual amplitude of the signal is not important (it doesn't matter if the
bit 0 is --__ or __--  ... ) .. only the frequency (or the "wave length") is
important.

  This is how Spectrum ROM routine does it, and normally all Turbo loaders do
it in the same way, only the timings are different (the frequency is bigger).

  Because not all tapes are in a perfect condition and because some tapes have
a lot of noise between blocks and ofcourse are therefore harder to convert, I
have included a series of switches that will help when recognising the tape.

  First of all it is best to sample the tape at highest possible sample rates.
The best result is achived with over 40kHz. You can use any sampling program
you want, but if you can, then use READSB or READVOC of the registered Z80
emulation package, since it does some very basic filtering which helps with
conversion.

  Here is what you should do when some problems are encountered:

- There are Checksum errors on most of the blocks (C.)

  Use /ignore switch... it should help. NOTE though that many turbo loaders
don't use the checksum and therefore it should be intentionally not right !
(like Alkatrazz loaders). The checksum is what the ROM save routine puts as
the last byte in the data ... it is XOR of all previous bytes.

- There are frequent Last Bytes with LESS than 8 bits converted (B1 or similar
  is shown)

  Again use /ignore switch. There MIGHT be some loaders that need less than 8
bits in Last Byte (the B part on the screen), but I haven't found them so far.
So if the game works with the /ignore switch then it is OK.

  In the next releases I might rename this to /noignore (and flip its behaviour)
since it is more usefull to always ignore the additional bits.

- The conversion splits some blocks when there should be only one block. i.e.
  You get A LOT of little blocks that don't make much sence

  The problem is that the algorythm thinks it is end of the block, when it
really isn't. The only switch that can correct this is /end . Use values of
80 - 95 and one should work.
  Sometimes the problem isn't in splitted blocks, but there is some noise
being recognised as PILOT tones... use /pilot 1000 or even higher (upto 2000)
when this happens.

- The conversion 'glues' two or more blocks together.

  Well, again, the same problem, only in the different direction... use /end
with values lower than 70 ... somewhere between 51 and 65 should do the job!

- The block gets converted OK, but then it just stops loading after the PILOT
  tone. (i.e. the pilot tone is recognised but no data is loading).

  The problem are the incorrect Sync pulses. The algorythm gets them sometimes
wrong. Use /sync  switch to correct the problem !

- The block gets converted wrong (i.e. loading picture is garbled, ...) and
  the /ignore switch doesn't help

  There are many reasons for this. The best way is to use one of these two
switches (or both of them together!) : /alter  and  /middle   ... they should
help !
  If they don't help then try using /diff  switch with values at around 45 - 49,
which sometimes does the trick.
  If the block uses ROM timings only then try using /rom  switch !

- Some blocks don't get recognised at all, or their Pilot tones are too short.

  Use /maxp switch with values either lower than 30 or higher than 40 ... it
depends on each case. It sometimes helps. If the pilot tones should be
actually shorter than 50 pulses then use /pilot switch with value less than 50.
(this is almost never the case).

- The blocks (normally in Alkatrazz loader) get converted OK, but the pilot
  tone is too short to be replayed successfully to the real spectrum.

  Use /force with values around 3000 to correct this problem. NOTE: this is
normally not needed for emulators, but somehow it does the job for the ZX.

- The blocks get recognised as CUSTOM Loading (with an * infront) when they
  are really Standard loading blocks.

  Use /std  switch with values higher than 30 (around 40-50 should help) ...
don't over do it or some real Custom loading blocks might be converted as
Standard ones !

  If none of the above tips help then load the .VOC file to an editor (such as
CoolEdit or GoldWave for Win95) and clean the spaces between blocks or make
bigger pauses between them... This should help out when the /end  switch can't
help.
